# Building Your First AI Model

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the process of building a basic AI/machine learning model using Python. The goal is to apply fundamental data science concepts, from data exploration to model evaluation, on a real dataset.

## Dataset
- The dataset used in this project is included in the repository (or specify source if from Kaggle/online).  
- It contains [brief description of dataset, e.g., number of features, type of data, target variable].

## Project Steps
1. **Data Loading**  
   Loaded the dataset using pandas and explored its structure.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Encoded categorical variables  
   - Scaled/normalized features as necessary

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized data distributions and relationships between features  
   - Generated insights to guide modeling decisions

4. **Model Building**  
   - Implemented [specify model, e.g., Decision Tree, Linear Regression, etc.]  
   - Trained the model on the dataset

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
   - Visualized performance with confusion matrices or plots

6. **Conclusions**  
   - Summarized findings and potential improvements  
   - Discussed model limitations and next steps

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ajraouz/DataScience.git
